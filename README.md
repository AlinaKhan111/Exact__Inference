# Traffic Congestion Prediction Using Bayesian Network - Exact Inference
This project demonstrates the use of Bayesian Networks to predict traffic congestion based on multiple factors such as weather conditions, time of day, traffic light state, and the occurrence of accidents. The model leverages the pgmpy library to construct the network, define conditional probability distributions (CPDs), and perform exact inference to deduce the likelihood of traffic congestion.

# Introduction
Traffic congestion prediction is a critical component of modern traffic management systems, enabling cities to optimize traffic flow and improve road safety. This Bayesian Network model provides a probabilistic approach to predict traffic congestion by analyzing various factors and their interdependencies.

The notebook exact__inference.ipynb contains the complete code for building the model and performing exact inference on traffic congestion.
